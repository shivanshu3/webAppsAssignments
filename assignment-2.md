# Assignment 2

## Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 1. If you have successfully completed the previous assignment, you may use your own code, or you can use the sample solution for Assignment 1, posted [here](http://ece.ubc.ca/~kumseok/src/vsp2018/solutions/assignment-1.zip), to complete this assignment.

In this assignment, you will make the web app responsive. That is, the app will be optimized for viewing across multiple devices and screen sizes. For this assignment, and some future ones, you will use the [PhotoGalleryLib](PhotoGalleryLib.js) library provided by us, which includes a lot of helpful functions. The documentation and some examples of how to use this library can be found [here](PhotoGalleryLib.md).

## Tasks

1. All you need to do for this task is print *to the javascript browser console* the size of the screen ("small", "medium", or "large") whenever it changes. (Hint: Look at PhotoGalleryLib.onSizeClassChange)
2. Remove the hardcoded table of images in your HTML file. We will dynamically generate it using JavaScript in this task, and add it to the DOM. Whenever the screen size changes (ex, from large to medium), the following should happen:
    - Delete the table of images from the DOM
    - Generate a new table of images for the current screen size (Hint: Look at PhotoGalleryLib.generateGrid)
    - Insert this new table into the DOM

## Submission Instructions

- Update either your own code from Assignment 1, or the sample solution code to accommodate the required changes for this assignment.
- Create a branch, and name it appropriately (eg. assignment-2)
- Make sure to push your changes to that branch before midnight (11:59 PM) on the date of the assignment deadline.
