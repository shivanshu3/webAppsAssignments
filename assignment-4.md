# Assignment 4

## Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 3. If you have successfully completed the previous assignment, you may use your own code, or you can use the sample solution for Assignment 3, posted [here](http://example.com), to complete this assignment.

In this assignment, you will remove the hardcoded list of images from your code, and will also stop using the local image files stored on your computer. You will using asynchronous requests (AJAX) to receive image URLs from a server, and use them to display the images in the grid.

## Tasks

1. For this task, you do not need to change the code which displays images in the grid. Add code to send a GET HTTP request to http://165.227.3.253:3000/images endpoint which returns a list of image URLs. Print this list of URLs to the console.
2. For this task, you will use the list of image URLs downloaded in the previous task to display them in the grid.
